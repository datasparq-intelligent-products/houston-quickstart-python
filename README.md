# Houston Quickstart Python

This repo contains guides and sample code for getting started with Houston on various platforms. The code used is almost 
identical across all platforms, but there are differences in how each platform's infrastructure needs to be set up. 

- [Local](./local): Run a mission locally (~5 minutes)
- [Google Cloud Platform](./google-cloud) (~15 minutes) 
- Amazon Web Services [coming soon]
- Microsoft Azure [coming soon]

For an interactive demo with fake plans and missions, try:
